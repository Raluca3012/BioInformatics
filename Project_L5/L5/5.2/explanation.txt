The position of each point reflects both the genome composition (C+G%) and the assembly time.
Viruses with higher GC content do not necessarily require more time, but their sequences tend to be more stable and complex.
The differences in assembly time mainly depend on genome size, sequence complexity, and the presence of repetitive regions.
